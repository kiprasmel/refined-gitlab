<!-- TODO FIXME ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ -->
Welcome. There's no manual so just read the source ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## web extension api docs

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API

## from merging PR to publishing

use the `build:beta` if you're sending the extension to beta testers instead of uploading to the chrome/firefox stores

```sh
yarn build
# or:  yarn build:beta

bash ./preupload.sh
```

the generated files are in [./distribution/](./distribution/) & [./web-ext-artifacts/](./web-ext-artifacts/).

## uploading/publishing to extension stores via CLI

For chrome web store, you'll need this: https://github.com/DrewML/chrome-webstore-upload/blob/master/How%20to%20generate%20Google%20API%20keys.md

For firefox: TBD
